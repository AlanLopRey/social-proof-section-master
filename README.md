## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS pre-processor
- [BEM metodology](https://getbem.com/) - Block Element Modifier metodology

### What I learned

This challenge was complicated, challenging and complex, I try to do my best to finish I learn how to use grid in the cards and the section set to flex box in order to get the efect of stairway

```css
.article {
  width: 20.625rem;
  height: 17.5rem;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 2fr 10fr;
```

### Continued development

I thing i made a mess in my SASS file so i think i need to practice more with more dificult challenges
